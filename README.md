# JHS Web Improvements (filter-lists)

This repository contains adblocker filter lists, userstyles, and userscripts to improve

Feel free to use, modify, and share the files in this repository, but I won't be accepting any contributions at this time.

## Filter Lists

[ios-filters.txt](ios-filters.txt)
- A mobile-oriented filter list initially designed for Brave iOS.
- Currently, strict blocking and `$removeparam` rules do not work on Brave iOS at the moment.

### Installation
1. Install an adblocker for your platform and browser
    - Windows/Linux/MacOS: 
      - Firefox, Chrome, Edge: [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock)
      - Some browsers such as Brave, Vivladi, and Opera GX have their own built-in adblockers
    - iOS:
      - [Brave iOS](https://brave.com/ios/) is free and has a decent built-in adblocker
    - Android:
      - uBlock Origin is avaliable for Firefox on Android
2. Import the filter list into your adblocker

## Userstyles
