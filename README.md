# filter-lists

Custom filter lists for uBlock Origin, Brave, and AdGuard.  
This repository also contains a few userstyles and userscripts.  

Feel free to use, modify, and share these lists, but I won't be accepting any contributions to this repository.

## Files

- [ios-filters.txt](ios-filters.txt)
  - A mobile-oriented filter list designed for Brave iOS.
  - Currently, strict blocking and `$removeparam` rules do not work on Brave iOS.
